# Discourse Tagger Plugin

A simple Plugin to allow users to attach labels (so called "tags") to their topics.

## Details


.To Note: this Plugins assumes tags are "moderated", meaning that only staff and users of the trust levels "leader" and "elder" are allowed to add new tags. Normal user can only pick from the list of pre-existing tags.

.Attention: This plugin requires discourse >= 0.9.9.7 . Please upgrade to master.

## Installation

Just two easy steps. From your main discourse do:

    cd plugins
    git clone https://github.com/werweisswas/discourse-plugin-tagger.git   # clone the repo here
    cd ..
    export RAILS_ENV=production                 # set to productions
    rake tagger:install:migrations              # copy migrations
    rake db:migrate SCOPE=tagger                # run migrations
    rake assets:precompile                      # precompile assets
